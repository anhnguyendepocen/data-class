# Data class

These course materials are designed for an introduction to computation and working with data. It will include organized data examples, a set of slides and examples, notebooks, etc.

Since I'm most comfortable programming in R, this class will mostly be taught using R.

Definitely a WIP; if you have thoughts/suggestions/additions please open a github issue.

# Topics

This is in no particular order, grouped by topic. As lectures come together I'll group these by the set of slides. Each group of topics will have a set of slides with an associated set of example scripts and data.

## Data
- Organizing and structuring datasets
- Tidy data frameworks and key-value pairs
- Web and other non-tabular formats
- Visual checks and identifying mistakes
- Unit tests and assertions for data
- Safe joining and merging of datasets

## Visualization
- A layered grammar of graphics, ggplot2, etc.
- Interactive plotting tools (plotly, highcharts)
- Javascript libraries, htmlwidgets (DT, leaflet)
- Simple interactive web applications with shiny

## Reproducible Research
- Structuring your project as a pipeline
- Notebook tools for exploration and writing (e.g. Jupyter, Rmarkdown)
- Documentation tools, managing requirements
- Version control and collaboration with git

## Programming
- Writing and documenting code
- Unit testing
- Functional programming
- Continuous integration tools

## Web stuff
- Working with APIs
- Web data structures (JSON & XML)

## Maybe other stuff
