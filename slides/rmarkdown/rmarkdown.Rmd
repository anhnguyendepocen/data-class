# What is RMarkdown?

  A fully reproducible, multi-language, notebook and reporting framework supported by RStudio.

# Why RMarkdown?

- Research is complicated
- Research is confusion
- You are lazy

---

# Why RMarkdown

> You get asked by your boss to update a chart, but for the life of you, you can't remember where the data came from!

---

# Why RMarkdown

> A reviewer gives you feedback--turns out your standard errors were _all wrong_ and you need to change the methodology. Ok which RA do we trust to run outreg a million times?

# Working with Rmarkdown

1. WTF is "markdown"
1. The RMarkdown Ecosystem
1. Code chunks and knitr options
2. WTF is YAML?
3. Templates
4. Parameters and automatic reports

# Markdown

System for producing HTML without having to write `<h1>Title</h1>` for titles, etc.

Meant to be not quite WYSIWYG, but easier to type.

$$A = \pi r^2$$


---

# Markdown Syntax

Headers:

* `# Text` for big titles (h1 tags)
* `## Text` for medium titles (h2 tags)
* you get the idea

---


# Markdown Syntax

Styles:

* `_word_` for _word_
* `**word**` for **word**

---

# Markdown Syntax

Unordered Lists:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
```

for

* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b

---

# Markdown Syntax

Ordered lists: 

```
1. First Item
1. Second Item
1. Third Item

```

1. First Item
1. Second Item
1. Third Item

---

# Markdown Syntax

* Line breaks via double spaces at end of line
* Links like `[linked_phrase](https://link.org)`
* Pictures like `![caption or alt text](images/picture/png)`
* Block quotes with `> text`
* Equations (inline) via `$\pi$`
* Block of equations with two dollar signs

# Markdown Syntax

Rstudio -> Help -> Markdown Quick Reference

---

# The RMarkdown Ecosystem

Requirements:

1. Latex
2. Pandoc
3. knitr
4. RMarkdown
5. Anything special (other packages, extensions)

---

# The RMarkdown Ecosystem

## External requirements

Latex:

Used to compile to PDFs

Pandoc:

Used to convert between file types (e.g. Word, PDF, HTML)


---

# The Rmarkdown Ecosystem
## R packages

knitr: R package that greatly extended the ability to run code within a text document, allowing for complicated research reports

rmarkdown: R package that extends knitr

extra stuff: extensions or template packages like `tufte` or `xaringan`


---

# Code Chunks and Options

RMarkdown lets you write code inside of text! How does it do that?

What was the markdown format for "code"?

---

# Code Chunks and Options

RMarkdown extends markdown's code syntax by letting you specify a language and processing options within the chunk of code, like so:

```
{r echo = T, warning = F, fig.width = 10 }

```

---

# Code Chunks and Options

* echo: whether to print code
* eval: whether to run the code
* include: whether to include any kind of output
* warning: whether to print warnings
* error: whether to print errors
* fig.width: width of printed figure
* fig.height: height of printed figure
* results: how knitr should post-process output during document conversion
* A WHOLE LOT MORE -> see `knitr::opts_chunk$get()`

---

# Quick sidenote

* There are lots of resources on rmarkdown

# WTF is YAML?

All that stuff at the top of an rmarkdown document is "YAML"

> Yet Another Markup Language

---

# WTF is YAML

This helps process how the documents get compiled. For example, title gets shoved in the "title" slot for a pandoc template.

---

# WTF is YAML

YAML syntax:

```yaml 
parameter1: argument
parameter2:
  deeper_parameters:
    list: t
    output: 'yes'
    etc: "ok we get the idea"
```

---

# WTF is YAML

Understanding how YAML works can help debug some weird problems! 

RMarkdown takes the arguments from the YAML info and passes it to `rmarkdown::render()`, which compiles the document.

Subparameters get passed to 

`rmarkdown::html_document()` or `rmarkdown::pdf_document()`

---

# Templates

Cool packages that extend base rmarkdown:

- [tufte](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/)
- [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)
- [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
- [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)

---

# Templates

You can also make your own! I did this for my firm to allow us to make pretty, branded documents.

I did this after reading about how [airbnb did it](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-r-packages-and-education-to-scale-data-science-at-airbnb-906faa58e12d) and it was easier than I expected.

We can talk about building packages a different time, but it is a _very_ convenient workflow that I highly recommend.

# Parameterized Reports

You can also [use variables in the YAML section for your own presentations and reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html)!
